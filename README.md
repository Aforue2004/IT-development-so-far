IT Experience at NCAIR
During my time at NCAIR, I collaborated with various individuals, primarily IT students, on multiple projects that significantly enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Below are a couple of key projects I worked on:

### Hangman Game

This project was particularly technical and challenged our team's ability to solve complex problems. It required logical thinking, effective collaboration, and continuous testing and refinement. Through this experience, I honed my programming skills and learned to tackle challenges methodically.

### API-Based Idea Generator

This project encouraged me to think outside the box. 
I explored diverse resources such as YouTube and Google to gather information and inspiration. It tested my research skills and pushed me to apply different concepts creatively. I learned the importance of utilizing various sources to inform my development process and enhance project outcomes.
Overall, these experiences at NCAIR provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in software development, teamwork, and critical thinking.
